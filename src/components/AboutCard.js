        <strong>How long does it take to build a website?</strong>
        <p>
          The timeline for building a website varies depending on the project's complexity and your specific requirements. On average, a standard business website takes about 4-6 weeks from initial consultation to launch. This includes time for design, development, revisions, and testing. For example, a basic brochure site might take less time, while an e-commerce site with custom features could take longer. We always keep you informed throughout the process, ensuring timely delivery without compromising on quality.
